<center># ESTATE:<br>A LARGE DATASET OF UNDER-REPRESENTED URBAN OBJECTS FOR 3D POINT CLOUD CLASSIFICATION</center>
#
We offer to the community the ESTATE dataset which combines available datasets creating from various sensors, densities, regions and object types. 

Why ESTATE?
- to better handle and segment generally under-represented urban objects in available datasets/benchmarks which can hardly be segmented with state-of-the-art neural networks;
- to support generalization issues across datasets using current deep learning approaches due to the heterogeneity of sensors, data and locations.

ESTATE includes 13 classes featuring intensity and/or colour attributes:
- Light Pole
- Traffic Light
- Pole
- Electrical Pole
- Traffic Sign
- Pylon
- Cable
- Garbage Box
- Car
- Truck
- Bus
- Chimney
- Ventilation

Some representative datasets for object classification in point clouds.</center>

ESTATE aims to improve the identification and classification of normally under-represented objects in urban point clouds, including generalization capabilities.

Our tests with ESTATE demonstrate that the dataset improves the classification performance of deep learning techniques and could be a game-changer to advance in the 3D classification of urban objects.
