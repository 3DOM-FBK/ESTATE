#
We offer to the community the ESTATE dataset which combines available datasets creating from various sensors, densities, regions and object types. 

Why ESTATE?
- to better handle and segment generally under-represented urban objects in available datasets/benchmarks which can hardly be segmented with state-of-the-art neural networks;
- to support generalization issues across datasets using current deep learning approaches due to the heterogeneity of sensors, data and locations.

ESTATE includes 13 classes featuring intensity and/or colour attributes:
- Light Pole
- Traffic Light
- Pole
- Electrical Pole
- Traffic Sign
- Pylon
- Cable
- Garbage Box
- Car
- Truck
- Bus
- Chimney
- Ventilation

Some representative datasets for object classification in point clouds</center>

Tests using ESTATE demonstrate that the dataset improves the classification performance of deep learning techniques and could be a game-changer to advance in the 3D classification of urban objects.
Deep learning algorithms for point cloud data have shown considerable capacity in 3D object classification but still face problems with generally under-represented objects (such as light poles or chimneys). This paper introduces
